<h2><b>Best Times to Visit Kyoto</b></h2>
<p>Each season has its pros and cons but if you're looking for a visual spectacle,
    your best bets would be
    <ul>
        <li>Late March to early April for the Cherry Blossoms</li>
        <li>Mid-Late November for the beauticall colours of the fall</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>You might want to avoid these times, which bring the largest crowds and the steepest prices.
    <ul>
        <li>Golden Week</li>(April 29 to 5 May)
        <li>Obon Festival</li>(August 13 to 15)
        <li>Cherry Blossoms</li>(Late March to Early April)
    </ul>
</p>
<p><b>Autumn</b> is a great time to be in Kyoto because this is when the prices drop, crowds thin, and foliage turns fiery orange and red. Temperature is also pleasant and comfortable for sightseeing.</p>

   <p><b>Winter</b> is great for budget travelers because airfares are lowest at this time. However, establishments tend to open later and close earlier.</p>
   <p><b>Spring</b>is also the beginning of peak season, when cost of flights and hotel rooms begin to rise. Yes, the sakura experience is magical, but prepare to shell out more dough and share the place with a bigger crowd.</p>

    <p><b>Summer</b> Not only are these months crowded, they can also be too hot. 
     Longer days also mean you have more hours of daylight, more time to explore, and more opportunities to take wonderful photos.</p>
